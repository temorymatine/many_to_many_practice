## Deliverables

We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb` from the command line. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here. Take a look at that file to see how you can pre-define variables and create object instances, rather than manually doing it in every single console session.

### Basic Class Methods and Properties

Task:  Build out the methods and relationships for a `Tourist` model, a `Landmark` model, and a `Trip` model.
